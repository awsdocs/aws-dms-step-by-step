AWS DMS now begins migrating data from MongoDB to Amazon DocumentDB\. The task status changes from **Starting** to **Running**\. You can monitor the progress by choosing **Tasks** in the AWS DMS console\. After several minutes, the status changes to **Load complete**\.

**Note**  
After the migration is complete, you can use the mongo shell to connect to your Amazon DocumentDB cluster and view the `zips` data\. For more information, see [Access your Amazon DocumentDB cluster using the mongo shell](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/getting-started.connect.html) in the *Amazon DocumentDB Developer Guide\.*
