# Step 9: Create and Run Your AWS DMS Migration Task<a name="chap-rdsoracle2aurora.steps.createmigrationtask"></a>

Using a AWS DMS task, you can specify what schema to migrate and the type of migration\. You can migrate existing data, migrate existing data and replicate ongoing changes, or replicate data changes only\. This walkthrough migrates existing data only\.

1. On the **Create Task** page, specify the task options\. The following table describes the settings\.    
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/sbs/chap-rdsoracle2aurora.steps.createmigrationtask.html)

   The page should look like the following:

1. Under **Task Settings**, choose **Do nothing** for **Target table preparation mode**, because you have already created the tables through Schema Migration Tool\. Because this migration doesnâ€™t contain any LOBs, you can leave the LOB settings at their defaults\.

   Optionally, you can select **Enable logging**\. If you enable logging, you will incur additional Amazon CloudWatch charges for the creation of CloudWatch logs\. For this walkthrough, logs are not necessary\.

1. Leave the Advanced settings at their default values\.

1. Choose **Table mappings**, choose **Default** for **Mapping method**, and then choose `HR` for **Schema to migrate**\.

   The completed section should look like the following\.

1. On the navigation pane, choose **Tasks**\.

1. Choose your migration task \(`migratehrschema`\)\.

1. Choose the **Task monitoring** tab, and monitor the task in progress on that tab\.
