After you have completed this walkthrough, perform the following steps to avoid being charged further for AWS resources used in the walkthrough\. It’s necessary that you do the steps in order, because some resources cannot be deleted if they have a dependency upon another resource\.

1. On the navigation pane, choose **Endpoints**, choose the Oracle source endpoint \(`orasource`\), and then choose **Delete**\.

1. Choose the Amazon Aurora MySQL target endpoint \(`aurtarget`\), and then choose **Delete**\.

1. On the navigation pane, choose **Replication instances**, choose the replication instance \(`DMSdemo-repserver`\), and then choose **Delete**\.

Next, you must delete your AWS CloudFormation stack, `DMSdemo`\.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [AWS CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation)\.

   Note that if you are signed in as an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) user, you must have the appropriate permissions to access AWS CloudFormation\.
