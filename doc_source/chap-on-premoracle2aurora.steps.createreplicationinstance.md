# Step 3: Creating a Replication Instance<a name="chap-on-premoracle2aurora.steps.createreplicationinstance"></a>

An AWS DMS replication instance performs the actual data migration between source and target\. The replication instance also caches the changes during the migration\. How much CPU and memory capacity a replication instance has influences the overall time required for the migration\. Use the following procedure to set the parameters for a replication instance\.

To create an AWS DMS replication instance, do the following:

1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com), and open the AWS DMS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/dms/v2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dms/v2/) and choose **Replication instances**\. If you are signed in as an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) user, you must have the appropriate permissions to access AWS DMS\. For more information on the permissions required, see [IAM Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Security.html#CHAP_Security.IAMPermissions)\.

1. Choose **Create replication instance**\.

1. On the **Create replication instance** page, specify your replication instance information as shown following\.    
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/sbs/chap-on-premoracle2aurora.steps.createreplicationinstance.html)

1. In the **Advanced** section, set the **Allocated storage \(GB\)** parameter, and then choose **Next**\.
