# Step 3: Test Connectivity to the Oracle DB Instance and Create the Sample Schema<a name="CHAP_RDSOracle2Redshift.Steps.ConnectOracle"></a>

After the CloudFormation stack has been created, test the connection to the Oracle DB instance by using SQL Workbench/J and then create the HR sample schema\.

**To test the connection to your Oracle DB instance using SQL Workbench/J and create the sample schema**

1. In SQL Workbench/J, choose **File**, then choose **Connect window**\. Create a new connection profile using the following information\.    
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/sbs/CHAP_RDSOracle2Redshift.Steps.ConnectOracle.html)

1. Test the connection by choosing **Test**\. Choose **OK** to close the dialog box, then choose **OK** to create the connection profile\.

**Note**  
If your connection is unsuccessful, ensure that the IP address you assigned when creating the CloudFormation template is the one you are attempting to connect from\. This issue is the most common one when trying to connect to an instance\.

1. Create the SH schema you will use for migration using a custom script\. The SQL script provided by AWS is located [https://dms\-sbs\.s3\.amazonaws\.com/Oraclesalesstarschema\.sql](https://dms-sbs.s3.amazonaws.com/Oraclesalesstarschema.sql)\. 

   1. Open the provided SQL script in a text editor\. Copy the entire script\.

   1. In SQL Workbench/J, paste the SQL script in the Default\.wksp window showing **Statement 1**\.

   1. Choose **SQL**, then choose **Execute All**\.

1. Verify the object types and count in SH Schema were created successfully by running the following SQL query\.

   ```
   Select OBJECT_TYPE, COUNT(*) from dba_OBJECTS where owner='SH'					
   GROUP BY OBJECT_TYPE;
   ```

   The results of this query should be similar to the following\.

   ```
   OBJECT_TYPE     | COUNT(*)
   ----------------+---------
   INDEX PARTITION |       40
   TABLE PARTITION |        8
   TABLE           |        5
   INDEX           |       15
   ```

1. Verify the total number of tables and number of rows for each table by running the following SQL query\.

   ```
   Select table_name, num_rows from dba_tables where owner='SH'  order by 1;
   ```

   The results of this query should be similar to the following\.

   ```
   TABLE_NAME | NUM_ROWS
   -----------+---------
   CHANNELS   |        5
   CUSTOMERS  |        8
   PRODUCTS   |       66
   PROMOTIONS |      503
   SALES      |      553
   ```

1. Verify the integrity in tables\. Check the number of sales made in different channels by running the following SQL query\.

   ```
   Select b.channel_desc,count(*) from SH.SALES a,SH.CHANNELS b where a.channel_id=b.channel_id 
   group by b.channel_desc 
   order by 1;
   ```

   The results of this query should be similar to the following\.

   ```
   CHANNEL_DESC | COUNT(*)
   -------------+---------
   Direct Sales |      710
   Internet     |       52
   Partners     |      344
   ```

**Note**  
The preceding examples are representative of validation queries\. When you perform actual migrations, you should develop similar queries to validate the schema and the data integrity\.
