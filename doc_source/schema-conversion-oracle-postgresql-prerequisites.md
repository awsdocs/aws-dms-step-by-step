The following prerequisites are also required to complete this walkthrough:

We recommend that you donâ€™t use your production workloads for the migration in this walkthrough\. After you get familiar with migration tools and AWS services, you can migrate your production workloads\.

Make sure that you create all your AWS and DMS Schema Conversion resources in the AWS Regions that support DMS Schema Conversion\. For more information, see the [list of supported Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_SchemaConversion.html#schema-conversion-supported-regions)\. In other Regions, you can use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool\. For an example of migration from Oracle to PostgreSQL with AWS SCT, see [Use Schema Conversion Tool to Convert the Oracle Schema to PostgreSQL](chap-rdsoracle2postgresql.steps.convertschema.md)\.
