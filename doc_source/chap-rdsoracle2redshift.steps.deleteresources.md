# Step 11: Delete Walkthrough Resources<a name="chap-rdsoracle2redshift.steps.deleteresources"></a>

After you have completed this walkthrough, perform the following steps to avoid being charged further for AWS resources used in the walkthrough\. Itâ€™s necessary that you do the steps in order, because some resources cannot be deleted if they have a dependency upon another resource\.

To delete AWS DMS resources, do the following:

1. On the navigation pane, choose **Tasks**, choose your migration task \(`migratehrschema`\), and then choose **Delete**\.

1. On the navigation pane, choose **Endpoints**, choose the Oracle source endpoint \(`orasource`\), and then choose **Delete**\.

1. Choose the Amazon Redshift target endpoint \(`redshifttarget`\), and then choose **Delete**\.

1. On the navigation pane, choose **Replication instances**, choose the replication instance \(`DMSdemo-repserver`\), and then choose **Delete**\.

Next, you must delete your AWS CloudFormation stack, `DMSdemo`\. Do the following:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS CloudFormation console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)\.

   If you are signed in as an IAM user, you must have the appropriate permissions to access AWS CloudFormation\.

1. Choose your CloudFormation stack, `OracletoRedshiftDWusingDMS`\.

1. For **Actions**, choose **Delete stack**\.

The status of the stack changes to DELETE\_IN\_PROGRESS while AWS CloudFormation cleans up the resources associated with the `OracletoRedshiftDWusingDMS` stack\. When AWS CloudFormation is finished cleaning up resources, it removes the stack from the list\.
