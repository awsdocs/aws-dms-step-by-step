# Step 10: Verify That Your Data Migration Completed Successfully<a name="CHAP_RDSOracle2Aurora.Steps.VerifyDataMigration"></a>

When the migration task completes, you can compare your task results with the expected results\.

**To compare your migration task results with the expected results**

1. On the navigation pane, choose **Tasks**\. 

1. Choose your migration task \(**migratehrschema**\)\.

1. Choose the **Table statistics** tab, shown following\.  
![\[ Table statistics tab\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/sbs/images/sbs-rdsor2aurora26.png)

1. Connect to the Amazon Aurora MySQL instance by using SQL Workbench/J, and then check if the database tables were successfully migrated from Oracle to Aurora MySQL by running the SQL script shown following\.

   ```
   Show databases; 
   Use HR;
   SELECT TABLE_NAME,TABLE_ROWS 
       FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES 
       WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'HR' and TABLE_TYPE='BASE TABLE' order by 1;
   ```  
![\[ Table statistics tab\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/sbs/images/sbs-rdsor2aurora27.png)

1. To verify whether the output for tables and number of rows from the preceding query matches what is expected for RDS Oracle, compare your results with those in the spreadsheet provided by AWS [at this site](https://dms-sbs.s3.amazonaws.com/AWSDMSDemoStats.xlsx)\.

1. Run the following query to check the relationship in tables; this query checks the departments with employees greater than 10\.

   ```
   SELECT B.DEPARTMENT_NAME,COUNT(*) 
     FROM HR.EMPLOYEES A,HR.DEPARTMENTS B 
     WHERE A.DEPARTMENT_ID=B.DEPARTMENT_ID 
     GROUP BY B.DEPARTMENT_NAME HAVING COUNT(*) > 10
     ORDER BY 1;
   ```

   The output from this query should be similar to the following\.

   ```
   department_name	count(*)
   Sales	34
   Shipping	45
   ```

Now you have successfully completed a database migration from an Amazon RDS Oracle DB instance to Amazon Aurora MySQL\.
