# Step 3: Test Connectivity to the Oracle DB Instance and Create the Sample Schema<a name="CHAP_RDSOracle2Aurora.Steps.ConnectOracle"></a>

After the CloudFormation stack has been created, test the connection to the Oracle DB instance by using SQL Workbench/J and then create the HR sample schema\.

**To test the connection to your Oracle DB instance using SQL Workbench/J and create the sample schema**

1. In SQL Workbench/J, choose **File**, then choose **Connect window**\. Create a new connection profile using the following information as shown following    
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/sbs/CHAP_RDSOracle2Aurora.Steps.ConnectOracle.html)

1. Test the connection by choosing **Test**\. Choose **OK** to close the dialog box, then choose OK to create the connection profile\.

**Note**  
If your connection is unsuccessful, ensure that the IP address you assigned when creating the CloudFormation template is the one you are attempting to connect from\. This is the most common issue when trying to connect to an instance\.

1. Create the HR schema you will use for migration using a custom script\. The SQL script provided by AWS is located [at this site](https://dms-sbs.s3.amazonaws.com/Oracle-HR-Schema-Build.sql)\. 

   1. Open the provided SQL script in a text editor\. Copy the entire script\.

   1. In SQL Workbench/J, paste the SQL script in the Default\.wksp window showing **Statement 1**\.

   1. Choose **SQL**, then choose **Execute All**\.

      When you run the script, you will get an error message indicating that user HR does not exists\. You can ignore this error and run the script\. The script drops the user before creating it,which generates the error\.

1. Verify the object types and count in HR Schema were created successfully by running the following SQL query\. You can also compare the results from the following queries with the results listed in the spreadsheet provided by AWS [at this site](https://dms-sbs.s3.amazonaws.com/AWSDMSDemoStats.xlsx)\. 

   ```
   Select OBJECT_TYPE, COUNT(*) from dba_OBJECTS where owner='HR'					
   GROUP BY OBJECT_TYPE;
   ```

   The results of this query should be similar to the following:

   ```
   OBJECT_TYPE	COUNT(*)			
   	INDEX	7			
   	PROCEDURE	2			
   	SEQUENCE	3			
   	TABLE	7			
   	VIEW	1
   ```

1. Verify the number of constraints in HR schema by running the following SQL query:

   ```
   Select CONSTRAINT_TYPE,COUNT(*) from dba_constraints  where owner='HR' 				
   	AND (CONSTRAINT_TYPE IN ('P','R')OR SEARCH_CONDITION_VC NOT LIKE '%NOT NULL%')				
   	GROUP BY CONSTRAINT_TYPE;
   ```

   The results of this query should be similar to the following:

   ```
   CONSTRAINT_TYPE	COUNT(*)			
   	R	         10			
   	P	          7			
   	C	          2
   ```

1. Verify the total number of tables and number of rows for each table by running the following SQL query:

   ```
   Select table_name, num_rows from dba_tables where owner='HR'  order by 1;
   ```

   The results of this query should be similar to the following:

   ```
   TABLE_NAME	NUM_ROWS			
   	COUNTRIES	25			
   	DEPARTMENTS	27			
   	EMPLOYEES	107			
   	JOBS	     19			
   	JOB_HISTORY	10			
   	LOCATIONS	23			
   	REGIONS	     4
   ```

1. Verify the relationship in tables\. Check the departments with employees greater than 10 by running the following SQL query:

   ```
   Select b.department_name,count(*) from HR.Employees a,HR.departments b where a.department_id=b.department_id 
   group by b.department_name having count(*) > 10
   order by 1;
   ```

   The results of this query should be similar to the following:

   ```
   DEPARTMENT_NAME	COUNT(*)
   Sales	    34
   Shipping	45
   ```
