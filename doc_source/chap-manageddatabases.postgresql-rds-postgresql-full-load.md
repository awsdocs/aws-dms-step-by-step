# Full Load<a name="chap-manageddatabases.postgresql-rds-postgresql-full-load"></a>

The full load migration phase populates the target database with a copy of the source data\. This chapter describes the following native methods to help you choose the one that best matches your migration scenario\.
+ pg\_dump and pg\_restore
+ Publisher and Subscriber
+ pglogical

We recommend that you begin by reviewing the following table to understand the tools suitable for your use case\.


| Method | Supported versions | Support of metadata migration | Suitable database sizes | Performance | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  pg\_dump and pg\_restore  |  All versions of PostgreSQL  |  Yes  |  100 GB or less  |  Medium  | 
|  Publisher and Subscriber  |  PostgreSQL 10\.0 and higher  |  No  |  Any size  |  High  | 
|  pglogical  |  PostgreSQL 9\.4 and higher  |  Yes  |  Any size  |  High  | 

The suitable database sizes provided in the preceding table are the AWS DMS recommendations\. These recommendations are based on customer migration experiences and arenâ€™t the limitation of the native tools\.

For more information about the performance of these tools, see [Performance Comparison](chap-manageddatabases.postgresql-rds-postgresql-performance-comparison.md)\.
